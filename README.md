A simple switch that turns off after a period of X.

Originally created to turn off my broken dryer.

Consist of a relay controlled by an arduino and two buttons, on and off.

If a user presses the on button the relay will turn on and stay on for 
a period of X.

If a user presses the off button the relay will turn off.
